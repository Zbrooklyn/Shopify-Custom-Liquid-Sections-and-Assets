## Developer Highlights: Custom Sections by Edward

As part of my work as a Shopify developer, I am building and enhancing custom sections for Shopify stores. This section highlights the features and updates I‚Äôm working on, especially in mobile responsiveness and features typically only available in paid themes.

### Custom Sections in Development

1. **Image Gallery Section**:
   - A fully responsive image gallery section with customizable grid layouts and interactive hover effects.
   - Includes mobile optimizations for seamless viewing across devices.

2. **Instagram Feed Section**:
   - A dynamic Instagram feed section that pulls your latest Instagram posts and displays them beautifully on your store.
   - Focus on mobile responsiveness and ensuring the section adapts to different screen sizes.

### Future Updates

- **Mobile Responsiveness Enhancements**:
   - Each section I build will include features that ensure they work perfectly on mobile devices, providing the same level of functionality as on desktops.

- **Paid Theme Features**:
   - My goal is to integrate features typically found in paid Shopify themes, such as advanced filtering options, enhanced animations, and performance optimizations.

Stay tuned as I continue to develop and release new sections!
